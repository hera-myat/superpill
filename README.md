# 👾 Uncommon Hacks UChicago

This project was developed at Uncommon Hacks Makes, held at the University of Chicago on 11/11/23. Our challenge was to envision a future food system for astronauts—focusing on alternative proteins—and find creative ways to make astronauts excited about it.

We created a single-page React.js application featuring an interactive button-based game. This not only showcased our concept but also applied skills learned during a React.js workshop at the hackathon.
